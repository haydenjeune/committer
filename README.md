# Committer

Committer is a small command line utility that makes it easy to set the details
that will be used to commit to the current git repo. This is useful if you have
different github accounts for uni, work, and personal things.

## Usage

I'm still working on this. I'll add things here as they're developed.

### Setting commit author

```
committer set <profile>
```

This will set the commit author of the repository that you are currently in to my details. `<profile>` can be anything, and the effect will be the same. I'm working on storing these details somewhere, so you can select a profile to use.
